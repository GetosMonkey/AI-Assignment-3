# Setup Instructions: 

Basically once you download the notebook that's all you need, other than two have the dataset as folder in the same folder/directory as the notebook so that my program can correctly read it in.

Assignment2.ipynb: Main program where all my working code blocks are
.gitignore: File mainly for version control on my github
README.md: setup instructions

(the report will be submitted as a seperate pdf)

The file structure should look something like this: 

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
